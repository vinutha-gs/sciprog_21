- Calculate the values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range[0,60]
every five degrees. Place the results in an array. Print the array.

1. Convert degrees to radians
2. loop over numbers 1 to 12 at one increment
3. for each number calculate the value of tan(x) in radians and store it in the array
4. Calculate the arae using the trapezoidal area
5. Compare it with the result of log(2)
