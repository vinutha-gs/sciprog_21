# Conversion.C

- Initialize a number as integer and then typecast it to float to check the output
- Convert the integer into binary format
- Count the number of digits in the binary expression using log and ceil function from math 
- Please use -lm option while doing a gcc compile

# Sum.c

- Completion of code to evaulate the sum of expression (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + .............+ 1/1000 )
- the sum is evaulated once in the increasion order 1 -> 1000 and stored in sum1
- the sum is again evaulated in reverse order 1000 -> 1 and stored in sum2
- - Even though they represent the addition of same set of numbers we see a very small difference between the two sums. This is due to the float datatype inconsistency.
